Overall instructions:

The aim of the lab is to challenge a few given assumptions on Object oriented development by creating a simple example and extending it over four iterations. Each iteration will add features and/or apply a restriction that will force the participants to refactor their existing design.

 


Build a Calculator that calculates the total price of all Order Items in an Order

      Iteration #1

     Requirements

    * An item has a quantity and a price
    * An order can have 0 - n OrderItems
    * Calculator must be able to calculate total on orders with >1 item
    * Calculator must handle items with different prices

    * Print an order summary that shows: 
           - each item on a new row, with the quantity and the total price.
           - an order total on the bottom row

   
   Restrictions
     * TDD (obviously)




    Iteration #2
    Rqquirements
    * Add discount (10%) if total over 1000
    * Item price and total displayed should be discounted price
    
    Restriction
    * All new code must be written in test and refactored (copy paste OK) to methods in production class
    

    should yield more testcases



    //Iteration #3
    // - Prices are before tax (25%) , the order summary needs to show the price after tax and discounts
    // Restriction
    //      - All Custom Objects must be immutable (final no setters, etc...)

    //Iteration #4
    // Restriction
    //      - Remove use of all Objects (except Wrapper object if using OO language)
    //         I.e no lists etc.
